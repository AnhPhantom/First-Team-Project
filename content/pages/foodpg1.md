# Food Review #1

## 1. Chick-fil-A —
Predictable, we know, but Chick-fil-A is the Holy Grail of fast food.
Weighing the quality of food against the price, the value is almost unbeatable.
Chick-fil-A takes pride in offering great food AND service at a reasonable price.
While it isn't necessarily the cheapest fast food, it also isn't the most expensive. 
Bottom line - you get what you pay for at Chic-Fil-A.
You can find Chick-fil-A either in the MSC or in the West Campus Food Hall.

## 2. Panda Express —
This may be a controversial addition to our list, but let us explain... 
Panda Express offers a lot of food for not a lot of money. As college students, volume is important when considering what to eat.
The food quality is about average in terms of taste, but you will definitely get enough to eat (maybe even enough for multiple meals).
You can expect decently large servings for relatively low prices.
Panda Express can be found in the MSC and on Polo Road.

# Food Review #2

## 1. Sbisa Underground Food Court —
If you are looking for fast food or a quick bite to eat on the north side of campus, then the Sbisa Underground is the place you will want to go.
Located just above it is the Sbisa dining hall for those not interested in fast food, but the underground has a decent selection.
The underground court has a Chick-Fil-A, Papa Johns for pizza, Houston Street Subs, and a Smoothie King.
The only thing to watch out for is how busy it can get.
The Sbisa underground is a popular place to eat and the line for Chick-Fil-A can get very long at times.

## 2. Starbucks at Evans Library —
The Starbucks at Evans is another popular place due to its location.
Evans is a popular place to study and even has some facilities located there such as the Writing Center.
Starbucks is popular enough as is, but this great location makes it a good place to go for a drink while studying.

## 3. The Commons Dining Hall —
Different from the last two places, The Commons Dining Hall does not offer fast food.
Instead this dining hall offers food that is closer to a home cooked meal on the south side of campus.
While not quite as good, it is still pretty good, especially if you live on campus near the area.
The location is not quite as central as the Starbucks at Evans, but The Commons is a good place to be as well.
The dining hall is quite spacious and above it there is a computer lab and plenty of seating to do what you want.
